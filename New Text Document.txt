To))) stay fit it's important to stay healthy mentally. This lockdown was a huge barrier for all of us but that didn't have a major impact on our health, to be honest. Some of the tips that I can impart are to wake up early and do meditation that helped me improvise mentally and stay calm during the hectic pandemic. I never stopped drinking water which is the major source to live healthily. Sleeping early and waking up early is very important and to have in-between healthy snacks like protein, nutrition, and good fat. So in this lockdown, we were all chefs in our own way. We tried everything literally with all ingredients available at our homes. The important role to be followed during this lockdown to stay fit is to do regular exercises like cycling, walking, and yoga. sleeping early is also very important in our daily life to be healthy. Due to lack of sleep, many people are affected by various health problems like insomnia, obesity, heart disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes.Â
